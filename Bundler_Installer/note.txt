When installing the installer service, keep in mind to:

1. Ensure that the installer.py is able to be executed using

    chmod +x /home/<username>/rabbitmqphp_example/Bundler_Installer/installer.py

2. Make sure that inotify-tools is installed on the machine

    sudo apt-get inotify-tools

3. Copy and place the installer.service file into /etc/systemd/system/ folder

4. sudo systemctl daemon-reload

5. sudo systemctl start installer.service

6. Then, to make sure that the service starts upon booting or rebooting

    sudo systemctl enable installer.service

7. Finally, to check and verify that the service is running

    sudo systemctl status installer.service

8. If there are any issues, check journalctl in realtime using

    sudo journalctl -u installer.service -f
