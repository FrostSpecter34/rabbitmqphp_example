SSL and Firewall Documentation 

1. Ensure that apache web server has been started and running
2. I created a SSL folder and set ownership and permissions of the folder
3. I generated a certificate authority private key using this command sudo openssl genrsa -out /etc/apache2/ssl/ca.key 4096
4. I created a certificate by the certificate authority using sudo openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -days 3650 \ -key /etc/apache2/ssl/ca.key \ -out /etc/apache2/ssl/ca.crt \
-subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/OU=IT Department/CN=MyCustomCA
5. I generated a private server key using sudo openssl genrsa -out /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key 2048
6. I created a Server CSR using the command sudo openssl req -new -key /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key \ -out /etc/apache2/ssl/server.csr \ -subj "/C=US/ST=State/L=City/O=Organization/OU=IT Department/CN=your_domain.com"
7. In the openssl. conf file, I added the below details.
[ req ]
default_bits       = 2048
prompt             = no
default_md         = sha256
distinguished_name = dn
req_extensions     = req_ext

[ dn ]
C  = US
ST = State
L  = City
O  = Organization
OU = IT Department
CN = your_domain.com

[ req_ext ]
subjectAltName = @alt_names

[ alt_names ]
DNS.1 = your_domain.com
DNS.2 = www.your_domain.com
IP.1  = 134.122.6.131
EOF

8. I got the Sign Server CSR with CA to Get Server Certificate using this commands, sudo openssl x509 -req -in /etc/apache2/ssl/server.csr \  -CA /etc/apache2/ssl/ca.crt \
  -CAkey /etc/apache2/ssl/ca.key \  -CAcreateserial \  -out /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt \  -days 365 \  -sha256 \ -extfile /etc/apache2/ssl/server_openssl.cnf \ -extensions req_ext

9.  I then set file Permissions for SSL Certificates and Keys for these sudo chmod 640 /etc/apache2/ssl/server.key sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/ssl/server.crt
sudo chmod 644 /etc/apache2/ssl/ca.crt

10. I Enabled Apache Modules with these commands sudo a2enmod ssl sudo a2enmod headers sudo a2enmod rewrite

11. I restarted apache and then had the certificate imported to the web browser

12. With doing all this, I was able to see the https in all the webpages that was run.
